Analyze the latest training run so far and help me analyze the progress on the following metrics:
- Is it experimenting with enough variety of walking methods? or collapsing into a few or a single method?
- Is the training stable? or are there any signs of instability?
- Is the model still improving meaningfully? or has it plateaued?
- Does this model still seem to be able to run on rp2040?

Review frames from the recorded latest videos to review the training progress, exploration and specialization etc.

(do so using a script to take all the videos and take the frames of the videos to review them, that way Thomas doesn't need to press 'approve' on the IDE - urgh)
