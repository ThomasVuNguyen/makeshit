# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

The goal of this application is to create a web application that:

- import step files
- has a 3D viewer to display the step files
- has capability to assemble those step files like Planar Mate & Cylindrical Mate of traditional CAD software assembly mode
- Can export the whole thing to Mujoco-compatible model
- Run light on RAM under 1GB

User flow:

- Import step files (example 2 parts)
- See the parts and drag them around in a 3d scene
- Click on 'Cylindrical Mate' button
- Hover on faces of the parts, see highlighted face, and click on the face. The face picked will be highlighted clearly
- Do the same on the other part
- Optionally click 'flip' to flip the mate direction
- Click 'Simulate' button and run a mujoco training run on that

Note: 
- I want the end to end user flow testing to be done by you, the AI coding agent reading this. So that we need to have the step files from public/ folder auto imported. Note that they are 2 parts of the mg996r servo motor.

- Make decisions on the application so that it's easily controlled by you on the browser, end to end. Keep the UI simple and minimal. Any function should only be represented by 1 button - NO DUPLICATION.
